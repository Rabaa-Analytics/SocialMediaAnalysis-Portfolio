What kind of data does the Facebook platform offer?
 And what can I leverage to provide real value to the client?
I began by analyzing the core metrics:
Organic Reach: The number of people who saw the content without paid ads.
Engagement: All types of interaction (likes, shares, comments, clicks).
Engagement Rate: The percentage of engagement compared to the number of people who saw the post.
Follower Growth: Tracking how the number of followers evolves over time.
Then, I expanded the analysis to include demographic data provided by Facebook:
By gender (male, female, unspecified)
By age range (18–24, 25–34, etc.)
By country or city
Here came the client’s real questions:
Who is my real audience? Where do they come from? And how old are they?
This type of analysis helps with:
Customizing marketing campaigns
Adjusting the tone of voice or content type
And sometimes even rethinking the product itself
Then I moved to another important question:
Is all content equally effective?
I used Facebook’s “Post Type” classification:
Video, Text ,Photo
For each type, I analyzed reach, engagement, and engagement rate.
 The goal: To identify which content type to focus on.
Finally, I added variance analysis over time:
Comparing this month to the previous month
Comparing this month to the same month last year
This kind of analysis helps us understand:
Is the performance really improving?
 Or is there a decline that requires quick intervention?
All these analyses and insights were delivered in a clean, easy-to-read interactive dashboard.
